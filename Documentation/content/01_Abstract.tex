With unmanned vehicles, there are always on-board and off-board components. Data transmission between those components is of vital importance. Depending on the distance between vehicle and ground station, different data transmission technologies are ideal.\\
In a previous project, a Serial Switch had been designed with four RS-232 interfaces that act as data input and output for devices and four RS-232 interfaces for transmitters and modems. The Serial Switch collects data from connected devices, puts it into a data package and sends it out via the configured transmitter. The corresponding second Serial Switch receives this package, extracts and verifies the payload, sends it out to the corresponding device and optionally sends an acknowledge back to the package sender.\\
The application runs on a Teensy 3.5 development board with FreeRTOS and data routing and transmission behavior is configurable by the user.\\
This document describes the refactoring and runtime analysis of the software developed in a previous project and the implementation of data security and reliability of data transmission. To improve reliability of data transmission, a Smart Wireless Selection algorithm was developed that choses the most reliable modem connected for transmission and the Golay error correction code can now be enabled to recover data in case of interference. Data security was implemented by adding a crypo acceleration libarary to the project. This library supports AES encryption which can later be used for secure data communication between two Serial Switches. Integrity of the log files can be ensured by computing the hash of the log file and adding the unique ID of the microcontroller to the hash algorithm so it is impossible to unnoticeably temper with the log data without knowing the UID.\\
The software concept developed in a previous project has been refactored and expanded. Now further improvements and extra functionalities can be implemented more easily as suggestions are given and issues are reported within this document.
