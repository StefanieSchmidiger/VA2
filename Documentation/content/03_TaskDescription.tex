This project has been done for the company Aeroscout GmbH. Aeroscout specialized in the development of drones for various needs. \\
With unmanned aerial vehicles, the communication between on-board and off-board devices is essential and a reliable connection for data transmission is necessary. While the drone is within sight of the control device, data can be transmitted over a wireless connection. With increasing distances, other means of transmission have to be selected such as GPRS or even satellite.\\
So far, the switching between different transmission technologies could not be handled automatically. The data stream was directly connected to a modem and transmitted to the corresponding receiver with no way to switch to an other transmission technology in case of data transmission failure. A visualization of this set up can be seen in
