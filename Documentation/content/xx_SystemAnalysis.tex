% System Analysis

Before implementing more features for the software written previously, the system performance needs to be analyzed to ensure sufficient capacity for error correcting codes and encryption.\\
In the previous project, SEGGER SystemView was used to analyze the runtime behaviour and CPU load of each task.\\
SEGGER SystemView is a real-time recording and visualization tool for embedded systems that reveals the true runtime behavior of an application, going far deeper than the system insights provided by debuggers. This is particularly effective when developing and working with complex embedded systems comprising multiple threads and interrupts: SystemView can ensure a system performs as designed, can track down inefficiencies, and show unintended interactions and resource conflicts, with a focus on details of every single system ticks \cite{SeggerSystemView}.\\
Because the limitations of SEGGER SystemView, the Percepio Tracealyzer used to provide a more in-depth insight into the runtime behaviour of the software. The Tracealyzer not only shows the
