This work is being done for Aeroscout GmbH, a company that specialized in development of drones. \\
With unmanned vehicles, there are always on-board and off-board components. Data transmission between those components is of vital importance. Depending on the distance between on-board and off-board components, different data transmission technologies have to be used. \\
So far, each device that generates or processes data was directly connected to a modem. This is fine while the distances between on-board and off-board components does not vary significantly. But as soon as reliable data transmission is required both in near field and far field, the opportunity of switching between different transmission technologies is vital. When data transmission with one modem becomes unreliable, an other transmission technology should be used to uphold exchange of essential information such as exact location of the drone.\\
In a previous project, a flexible hardware was designed that acts as a Serial Switch between devices and modems. The software written in previous projects provides basic functionalities such as data routing between all connected devices and modems. All data read on device side is put into packages and sent out on wireless side. Acknowledgements for packages can be enabled and the retransmission behavior can be specified in the configuration file located on the SD card. The software completes its main functionality correct but has only briefly been tested and is still in a first stage.\\
The goal of this project is to enhance the overall performance of the Serial Switch by improving the reliability of the data exchange and adding data security. The software written in the previous project should be enhanced by adding logging and any other essential features that are needed for future development. Then the software should be analyzed to get an understanding of its overall performance and runtime behavior. If enough resources are left, data security and should be implemented by adding encryption. Furthermore, data integrity for the log files should be added so that the logged data cannot be modified without notice, similar to the concept of a black box in flight systems.\\
The reliability of the data exchange on wireless side should be improved as well. This should be done by improving the retransmission behavior of data packages, by adding an algorithm that choses the most reliable modem for data transmission and by adding an error detection and correction algorithm.\\ \\
The detailed requirements for this project can be found in chapter two. Chapter three describes the approach to fulfill all requirements and the project plan written for this project. An overview of the status of the previous projects is given in chapter four, describing the hardware used, the software concept of the previous project, a runtime analysis of the software and any small changes done and features added to this application that are required for further development. The configuration possibilities and limits of the modems used on wireless side are described in chapter five. Chapter six focuses on the implementation of data reliability and data security is described in chapter seven. Both project conclusion and personal conclusion can be found in chapter eight.
